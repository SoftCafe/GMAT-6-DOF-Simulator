Cesium Ion and GMAT

Build a custom visualization frontend of top of Cesium Ion
Build a 6 DOF simulator on top of GMAT

SPICE database 
	- NASA's CSPICE format
	
	
	
Gage started work on 	
Direct Transcription / Collocation 
GTO/GEO GPOPS-II for doing direct transcription
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPOPS-II

He is next working on Matlab/Simulink versions of GPOPS-II
?  Will he need some help. ?



Thought, do a Sci Tools understand analysis of GMAT GUI to establish interface actions.

	Obtain SPICE/CSPICE format

	Devise transformation of CSPICE

	Data flow diagrams
	Class Diagrams
	Block diagrams
	Dependencies analysis
	
	Eventual focus needs to go toward prioritary algorithms
	
	Examples from GMAT Central:

Four slide presentation of wavelets

SourceForge migration from github repo.

Double check GMAT build for Windows
	 Why Win7
	 Why WinX
Block diagram of dependencies:

The Win7 we have is 32-bit.  Adjust VM to run as a 32-bit machine.


??? The contractor ??? What did they do?  Some kind of optimization 



Don issue:
Transcription and Collocation for proprietary A-to-B orbital/trajectory optimization algorithm.
psuedo-geodesic.
Why: Continuous acceleration by plasma/ion propulsion





Jeff made a new attitude model for 6DOF..  
Runs on his version of OSX 
GMAT central to add attitude control module

The space craft in the simulation "knows" where it is.
It has the location and time information in the simulation object
? How do the propergators interact with the "spacecraft" objects.

Contributing to Development
You can add new features to GMAT and see those features adopted by the community.  Our process for contributing code to GMAT is covered in the Governance pages.   You don't need to be an expert in C++ to contribute to GMAT functionality.  You can
Write engineering specs
Write prototypes (we rely heavily on MATLAB prototypes)
Review requirements and design documents
Fix bugs
Improve existing features
Add a new features
For more information see the Development launchpad.

CFE/CFS?  Could we stick the models into the Sat itself.  A hardware in the loop would to connect devices and their simulations.

Is there a generic attitude model we can apply for GMAT?   Can a "text" file we can make that will make the correct model of the space-craft for GMAT to simulate this work.
