# How to Organize Source Code Packages 

Place reusable source code in this directory.

## Motivation

The book "Space Mission Engineering: The New SMAD" decomposes an "Attitude
Determination an Control System" into the following categories
 * Attitude Actuators
 * Attitude Sensors
 * Control Laws
 * Definitive Attitude Determination
 * External Disturbance Torques
 * Internal Disturbance Torques
 * Real Time Attitude Determination
 * Spacecraft Dynamics

We have organized our source code directory structure around this taxonomy.
