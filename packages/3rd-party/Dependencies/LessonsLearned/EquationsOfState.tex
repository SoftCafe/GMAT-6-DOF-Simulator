\begin{eqarray}
J_1\dot{\omega}	 = \J_2(\omega_2 - \omega_3)\omega_2 \omega_3 + T_{1,ext} + u_1\\
J_1\dot{\omega}	 = \J_2(\omega_1 - \omega_3)\omega_1 \omega_3 + T_{2,ext} + u_2\\
J_1\dot{\omega}	 = \J_2(\omega_2 - \omega_1)\omega_2 \omega_1 + T_{3,ext} + u_3

Work with Gage and Colin to make examples.  What do the textbooks say about these equations?  If a prof of orbital mechanics is teaching a class on these equations, what examples do they use?  

What modeling tools do Aeronautical Engineers use?  What are they focusing on in terms of the model?  

What does an interface between GNC and tools like GMAT?
