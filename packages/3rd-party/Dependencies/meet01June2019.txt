         1) Colin H    :  a) We have a GitHub project (register w/ GitHub & Colin for access):
                            https://github.com/a093130/GMAT-6-DOF-Simulator                       
                            Wiki page can be found here:
                            https://github.com/a093130/GMAT-6-DOF-Simulator/wiki
                            You must register with GitHub for a free account and username
                            then provide this info to Colin (chelms@airst.org) to gain
                            access to the GMAT-6-DOF-Simulation project.
                            Some of the specifications are in the Wiki.
                         b) Exploring the Deep Space Gateway Mission Con-Ops.
                         c) Explore a rendezvous Mission Ops with the Apophis asteroid.
                         d) Continue finishing up "The Paper" (FTDP). 

2) Daniel B    :    a) Continue testing GMAT interoperable compilation via cmake on Apple Mac. 
                    b) Once satisfied, this can be ported to Linux (easily) and then Windows. 
                    c) (optional) Is anyone else doing this (upgrading GNC or Attitude module)? Who are they? 
                    d) Please update our Wiki with what you've learned re: cmake. A script would be nice.

3) Don V        :   a) Coordination & Communication 
                    b) Retro simulation text 

4) Gage G     :     a) Look into 'Phase Plane Control' (Phase Space). 
                    b) Work with Colin (chelms@airst.org) to determine & List Control Laws. 
                    c) Determine a modular architecture w/i GMAT guidelines to generate the control laws. 

5) Joe M       :    a) Colin has created a Wiki page within the GitHub account, here:
                                                https://github.com/a093130/GMAT-6-DOF-Simulator/wiki
                       There is GMAT documentation here that may answer the GMAT i/f questions:
                       1) Configuring the Attitude (Spinner satellite):
                       http://gmat.sourceforge.net/doc/nightly/html/ch03s05.html
                       2) Configuring the Attitude (Fixed axis satellite)
                       http://gmat.sourceforge.net/doc/nightly/html/ch04s04.html
                       3) How to Add a new Attitude Parameter
                       http://gmatcentral.org/display/GW/How+to+Add+a+new+Attitude+Parameter
                       4) How to Add an Attitude Model to GMAT:
                       http://gmatcentral.org/display/GW/How+to+Add+an+Attitude+Model

                    b) Explore Android project.




Absent: 
6) Jonathan N  :    a) Retro simulation code. 


Answered & unanswered GMAT interface questions that should be answered in our Wiki: 
            What Attitude measurements are available? 
            What coordinate systems? 
            How to specify desired attitude? 
            How do we (GMAT) know what the attitude is? 
            How do we specify control torques to GMAT? 
            What signals are supplied by GMAT and how?
            What coordinates are they in?
            What are the Libs and their Methods to change coordinate systems?


Any Questions?



Thanks, Fellows.
